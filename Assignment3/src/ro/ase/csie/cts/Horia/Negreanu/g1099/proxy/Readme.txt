Task Management application for businesses:

The task currently has a title and a description attribute. When adding a task to the database, 
currently the description can be empty.
The module which adds a task to the database should be changed so an empty description is no longer allowed.

Advantages:
1. Adds an extra validation without changing the class, only the flow in the main.
2. Can be easily applied, without interruption the application.

Disadvantages:
1. The main must be changed to apply the proxy.
